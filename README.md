# hosttechAutoscale (deprecated)

Scales your virtual servers at [hosttech.cloud](https://hosttech.cloud)

The Script initialises itself and creates a configfile. Start with `./autoscale.sh`

## Requirements

It's tested on Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 9 and Debian 10. It should work on any Debain-based Distribution.
It also works on CentOS 7 and CentOS 8, but requires `jq` to be installed manually.
